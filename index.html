<p>This document will provide an overview of how the Bifrozt deployment should look like and how it will work once it's complete, define the requirements for this deployment, explain the two different ways to deploy Bifrozt and provide a step by step instruction of the most common method.</p>

<h4>
<a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview.</h4>

<p>Generally speaking, Bifrozt is a NAT device with a DHCP server that is usually deployed with one NIC (eth0) connected directly to the Internet and one NIC (eth1) connected to the internal network.<br></p>

<p><img src="https://www.honeynet.org/sites/default/files/images/deploy_example.png" alt="Example deployment"></p>

<p>What differentiates Bifrozt from other standard NAT devices is its ability to work as a transparent SSHv2 proxy between an attacker and your honeypot. The software that's being used as a SSHv2 proxy is called <a href="https://github.com/tnich/honssh">HonSSH</a> and has been developed by Thomas Nicholson.
<br><br>
If you deployed a SSH server on Bifrozt's internal network it would log all the interaction to a TTY file in plain text that could be viewed later and capture a copy of any files that were downloaded. You do not have to install any additional software, compile any kernel modules or use a specific version or type of operating system on the internal SSH server for this to work
<br><br>
To prevent the attackers from using the honeypot to attack other systems it will limit outbound traffic to a set number of ports, number of connections and the amount of packets being sent, if the firewall finds that any of these limits are exceeded it will start to drop the connections and/or packets sent.</p>

<a id="requirements" class="anchor" href="#requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Requirements.</h4>

<h5>
<a id="hardware" class="anchor" href="#hardware" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hardware.</h5>

<p>Minimum hardware requirements (recommended within parenthesis).</p>

<p>Bifrozt</p>

<ul>
<li>2x network interface cards</li>
<li>1 GB RAM (2 GB or more recommended)</li>
<li>10 GB Hard drive (20 GB or more recommended)</li>
<li>1 CPU (2 or more recommended)</li>
</ul>

<p>Honeypot</p>

<ul>
<li>The hardware requirements should reflect the type of server thats being offered.</li>
</ul>

<h5>
<a id="software" class="anchor" href="#software" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Software</h5>

<p>Bifrozt</p>

<ul>
<li>Running Ubuntu 14.04 or later (server version recommended but, works with Desktop version as well).</li>
<li>OpenSSH server (will be added automatically if using local installation method)</li>
</ul>

<p>Honeypot</p>

<ul>
<li>OpenSSH server</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<a id="installation-options" class="anchor" href="#installation-options" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation options.</h4>

<p>There are mainly two ways of installing the components that turns a system into a honeypot router (aka. Bifrozt)</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Install locally using Ansible.</strong><br>  If you only plan in using a single instance of Bifrozt (which is the most common way of doing it) you should install it locally.</li>
<li>
<strong>Install from a Ansible control machine.</strong><br>  If you have a large infrastructure, plan on deploying Bifrozt to multiple nodes or already have a Ansible control machine installed its only natural to deploy Bifrozt from that.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you already are using Ansible and have a control machine I assume that you are able to deploy without any further instructions. 
<br></p>

<h5>
<a id="install-locally-using-ansible" class="anchor" href="#install-locally-using-ansible" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Install locally using Ansible.</h5>

<p>This is the most common way of deploying Bifrozt but, can also be a bit tricky if you never used Ansible before, so i've created a bash script that does most of the tasks for you.<br>
Even tho i've created this script i'd like you to be aware of what this script is doing, this will help you troubleshoot any potential issues with it and give a better understanding of the process.
<br><br>
When executed it will preform three checks that <strong>must</strong> be passed</p>

<ul>
<li>The executing user is <em>root</em>.</li>
<li>The operating system is <em>Ubuntu</em>.</li>
<li>The system has two network interface cards (not counting local interface) and both starts with <em>eth</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>To run the playbook locally on the machine you would like to use as Bifrozt, execute the following commands<br>
<code>wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bifrozt/bifrozt-ansible/master/bifrozt_setup.sh</code><br></p>

<p>This will download the <code>bifrozt_setup.sh</code>, to run it you have to find the MAC address of your honeypot. The MAC address must be given as an argument to the script as shown in the example below.</p>

<p><code>sudo bash bifrozt_setup.sh 00:11:22:33:44:55</code><br>
<br></p>

<p>When the script completes you will see a post setup summary, similar to this:<br></p>

<pre><code>=================================================

Post setup actions:
    1) If the honeypot is running, power it off now.
    2) Reboot this machine.
    3) Reconnect: ssh -l [name of user] 10.109.133.14 -p 59051 
    4) Start the honeypot.
    5) Start HonSSH: sudo honsshctrl start.

=================================================
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure to take note of what port number has been chosen for SSH administration,<br>
this displayed in <strong>3)</strong>. In this case the SSH server has been configured to run on port <strong>59051</strong>.<br>
What should be mentioned is that, when starting HonSSH, it will start to tail its application log. This is only for convenience, pressing CTRL + C will stop <code>honsshctrl</code> from tailing the log but, it will <strong>not</strong> stop HonSSH.   </p>

<p>Example of what the <code>bifrozt_setup.sh</code> script will look like.<br></p>
